The binary was downloaded from `https://downloads.rclone.org/v1.75.2/` and its archive was verified against the
official `SHA256SUMS` (included next to the binary).

## WinFsp (official installer included in `GameStreamX-…-setup.exe`, v2.1.25156)

https://winfsp.dev, Copyright (C) Bill Zissimopoulos / Navimatics LLC. GPLv3 with a FLOSS exception. Source
code: https://github.com/winfsp/winfsp. The setup program carries the unmodified, Authenticode-signed
`winfsp-2.1.25156.msi` from https://github.com/winfsp/winfsp/releases and runs it only when WinFsp is missing.
GAMESTREAM X does not link WinFsp; rclone uses the WinFsp installation present on the system. WinFsp is a separate
program with its own uninstall entry ("WinFsp 2025").
